# Project 2: Using Yara for Real-time Threat Hunting

## Introduction
This project will guide you through using Yara for real-time threat hunting in a live environment. You will set up a monitoring environment, deploy Yara rules across multiple endpoints, conduct real-time scans, and investigate suspicious activity. This hands-on experience will enhance your ability to detect and respond to security threats in real-time.

## Lab Setup and Tools
- A system with Linux
- Yara installed
- Multiple endpoints (can be virtual machines) with Yara installed
- Centralized logging server (optional, for aggregating logs)

## Tool Installation

### Install Yara
#### On Linux (Debian-based):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install yara
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up a Monitoring Environment
Steps:

1. Set up a centralized logging server (optional but recommended) to collect and aggregate logs from all endpoints.
2. Configure endpoints to send logs to the centralized logging server. This can be done using syslog, Fluentd, or any other logging framework.
   
**Expected Output**:

- A centralized logging environment where logs from all endpoints are aggregated.
  
### Exercise 2: Deploying Yara Rules Across Endpoints

**Steps**:

1. Create a directory on each endpoint to store Yara rules.
```bash
mkdir /etc/yara-rules
```
2. Copy your Yara rules to the /etc/yara-rules directory on each endpoint.
3. Create a script to run Yara scans periodically. For example, create a file named yara_scan.sh with the following content:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yara -r /etc/yara-rules /path/to/scan
```
4. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x yara_scan.sh
```
5. Set up a cron job to run the script at regular intervals:
```bash
crontab -e
```
- Add the following line to run the script every hour:
```bash
0 * * * * /path/to/yara_scan.sh >> /var/log/yara_scan.log 2>&1
```
**Expected Output**:

- Yara rules are deployed and periodic scans are set up on all endpoints.
  
### Exercise 3: Conducting Real-time Scans
**Steps**:

1. Ensure that the yara_scan.sh script is running as scheduled on all endpoints.
2. Check the logs on each endpoint or the centralized logging server to see the results of the scans:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/yara_scan.log
```
**Expected Output**:

- Real-time scan results are available in the logs.


### Exercise 4: Investigating Suspicious Activity
**Steps**:

1. Monitor the logs for any matches reported by Yara.
2. When a match is found, investigate the file that triggered the alert.
```bash
yara -r /etc/yara-rules /path/to/suspicious/file
```
3. Analyze the file using additional tools such as strings, hexdump, or a sandbox environment.
   
**Expected Output**:

- Detailed investigation results for any suspicious activity detected by Yara.

### Exercise 5: Enhancing Yara Rules for Better Detection
**Steps**:

1. Based on the investigation, update your Yara rules to improve detection accuracy.
```yara
rule ImprovedRule {
    strings:
        $str1 = "malicious_string1"
        $str2 = "malicious_string2"
    condition:
        $str1 and $str2
}
```
2. Deploy the updated rules to all endpoints.
3. Repeat the real-time scans and monitoring to validate the effectiveness of the improved rules.
**Expected Output**:

- Enhanced Yara rules with improved detection capabilities are deployed and validated.

## Conclusion
By completing this project, you will have gained hands-on experience in using Yara for real-time threat hunting. This advanced skill is crucial for cybersecurity professionals, enhancing your ability to detect and respond to security threats in real-time effectively.
